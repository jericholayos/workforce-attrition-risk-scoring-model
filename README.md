## Overview
End-to-end data analysis project identifying the key drivers of employee attrition. SQL was used for exploratory data analysis and deep-dive querying. Power BI was used to build a dashboard presenting findings to a non-technical audience.

## Key Insights

Overall attrition rate: **16.12%** (237 out of 1,470 employees)

**Overtime** is the biggest factor. Employees who work overtime leave at a much higher rate than those who don't (127 vs 110 attrition cases, despite being the smaller group).

**Department** makes a difference. Sales loses the most employees relative to its size, while R&D retains the most.

**Job role** tells a similar story. Sales Representatives have the highest chance of leaving, and Sales Executives account for a large share of total departures.

**Age** peaks in the 25-34 range, which has the most departures (112), followed by 35-44 (51). The youngest and oldest employees leave the least.

**Education** shows Bachelor's degree holders leaving the most (99), but they also make up the largest group. Doctorate holders rarely leave (5).

**Engagement** matters across the board. Employees who left tended to rate their work-life balance and work environment lower than those who stayed.

**Gender** shows more male departures (150 vs 87), but this is likely because there are more male employees overall.

### High-Risk Profile

Employees most likely to leave are aged 25-34, working in Sales, doing overtime, and reporting low satisfaction with their workload and environment.

### Summary

Most attrition comes down to overwork and role type, especially in Sales. Employees doing overtime in low-satisfaction roles are the highest risk group.
